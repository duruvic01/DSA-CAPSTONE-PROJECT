## Project Overview: 
To analyze product sales data from Amazons review operations in order to identify trends, insights and patterns that can inform decision-making. The goal is to utilize my newly gotten skills in Microsoft Excel such as data cleaning, summarization, pivot tables, charts and dashboards, to make this possible. 
### Data Source: 
The dataset used, titled  *Amazon case study.xlsx* was provided by DSA & the Incubator Hub as part of the requirements in fulfillment and completion of my course Data Analysis with them.

#### Features used ;
-	Excel Formulas: Used PRODUCT, IF functions for data manipulation e.g
  ``` =IF(H19<200,"₹200",IF(OR(H19=200,H19=500),"₹200-₹500",">₹500")) ```
-	Pivot Tables: Used to summarized
  o	 Average discount by category
  o	  No of Products  per category
  o	 Total Reviews per category etc.

### Recommendations :
On the basis of this analysis, the following recommendations  are made:
-	**Focus shifted on High-Performing Products**:
More priority should be given on marketing and inventory products like tablets and headphones with high ratings and engagement.
-	**Improving Low-Performing Categories**: 
Consider reevaluating underperforming categories like Media Streaming Devices.
-	**Leverage High-Revenue Categories**:
A more strategical approach is advised in Mobile & Accessories, given their massive revenue potential.
